Bromeliad family is large and diverse, containing thousands of species ranging from Pineapples to Air Plants, but the Bromeliodeae subfamily is the one that contains the plants that are most commonly grown by people indoors, and includes epiphytes (plants that naturally grow on trees) as well as plants adapted to terrestrial growth.  Some people have an allergic reaction after handling a Bromeliad, so care should be taken if you handle these plants which grow naturally in Africa and tropical America and indoors in more northern areas.  Bromeliads have no known hazards and would look good in a tortoise enclosure - particularly enclosures for tortoises from tropical forest environments (Redfoots, Yellowfoots, etc.) where they can enjoy the occasional nibble, and the presence of water (use rainwater) in the central well of the plant leaves and misting will contribute to the high humidity that is needed by the plant and the tortoise.","category":"5","colour":null},{"id":"550","name":"Broom (Common Broom, Spanish Broom, Scotch Broom, English Broom, French Broom)","common":"Broom (Common Broom, Spanish Broom, Scotch Broom,

member of the Brassica family and contains goitrogens, so it should be fed in limited quantities only.  Never feed the root of the Horseradish.Please be aware that two or more goitrogenic plants should not be fed in conjunction with each other, and the sum total of goitrogenic foods should not exceed the guideline for a single plant of 'in moderation' (amber-green) or 'sparingly' (amber-red).

have been observed eating Alliums in the wild, as part of a wide and varied diet, and although a nibble of a flower or leaf will probably do no harm, we do not recommend feeding Wild Garlic on the general principle that plants from bulbs are not suitable as tortoise food.  Do not confuse with Allium vineale, which is also often called Wild Garlic.Wild Garlic leaves can be easily confused with those of Lily of the Valley and Lords and Ladies, both of which are toxic, so be sure of your identification.   A good means of positively identifying Wild Garlic is to rub the leaves between your fingers, which should produce a garlic-like smell.  Also, the stems of the leaves are triangular-shaped.  When the leaves of Wild Garlic and Lords and Ladies first sprout they look similar, but when the leaves unfold Lords and Ladies leaves have irregular edges and many deep veins, while those of Wild Garlic are convex with a single main vein.  The leaves of Lily of the Valley come from a single purple stem, while the Wild Garlic leaves have individual green-coloured stems.","category":"6","colour":"white"},{"id":"804","name":"Wild Ginger","common":"Wild
